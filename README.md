Workflow
  A. RNA
1. pick samples -
2. download RNA reads and process them completely following code
3. run DGE
4. visualize with heatmap
5. enrichment analysis

   B. Methylation
1. download reads
2. process them
3. run DMA
4. visualize with heatmap
5. enrichment analysis

    C. Harmonization
1. extract overlapping genes
2. map overlapping genes
3. visualize with heatmap
4. run statistics

    D. Network analysis
1. analyze hub genes and gene networks
